# LP3-Regression_Project
A time series project
## Project Title: 
### `Sales Forecasting and Inventory Optimization For Ecuador Retail Businesses`
## Project Understanding and Description:
Develop a time series forecasting model to predict retail sales for different stores in Ecuador.

Integrate external factors like oil prices and holiday events to enhance the accuracy of the forecasts.

Explore how optimized sales forecasting can lead to better inventory management and cost savings.`

### 1. `Business Objective:`

To improve sales forecasting and optimize inventory management for retail stores in Ecuador 

by leveraging historical sales data, oil prices, and holiday information.

####       `Anticipated Business Impact:`
(i) Reduce overstock and stockouts, leading to increased customer satisfaction.

(ii) Optimize inventory levels, improving cash flow and reduce holding costs.

(iii) Enhance operational efficiency in responding to seasonality and holiday demand.

### 2. `Assess Situation:`

####   (i) `Resource Availability:`

Access to historical sales data, oil prices, and holiday information.

A team of skilled data analysts and data scientists.

Adequate computational resources for data processing, analysis and modeling.

####   (ii) `Project Requirements:`

Develop a time series forecasting model by making use of available data.

Integrate data from:

(a) 'oil', 'holidays_events', 'stores', and 'transactions'; 

These datasets contain the relevant information required for time series forecasting, 

such as sales transactions, store information, and external events that may impact the time series.

(b) 'sample_submission' and 'test': These datasets will be useful for evaluating the model's performance. and

(c) 'train': This is the main training dataset for building and training the forecasting model.

####   (iii) `Address missing data and ensure data quality.`
Implement visualization for exploratory data analysis.

Evaluate model performance using relevant metrics.

####   (iv) `Risks and Contingencies:`

Risks that may occur include inaccurate or incomplete data, and potential challenges in modeling complex retail sales patterns.

Possible contingencies that we might incur are; thorough data cleaning, exploration, and collaboration with domain experts for better understanding.

####   (v) `Cost-Benefit Analysis:`

Costs expected include data storage, computational resources, and human resources.

Benefits include improved sales forecasting, optimized inventory, and potential revenue increase.

### 3. `Data Mining Goals:`

(i) To develop a time series forecasting model for retail sales.

(ii) Explore the impact of oil prices and holidays on sales.

(iii) Identify patterns and trends in the data to improve decision-making.

(iv) Optimize model parameters for accurate sales predictions.

### 4.  `Project Plan:`
#### (a) `Phase 1: Data Preparation`

Clean and preprocess data (handle missing values, outliers, and format issues).
Merge relevant datasets ('oil', 'holidays_events', 'stores', and 'transactions').

#### (b) `Phase 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)`
Visualize time series data, identify seasonality and trends.
Explore the relationships between sales, oil prices, and holidays.

#### (c) `Phase 3: Model Development`
Choose and implement a time series forecasting model (e.g., SARIMA, LSTM).
Train the model on historical data.

#### (d) `Phase 4: Model Evaluation`
Evaluate model performance on a test set.
Fine-tune hyperparameters for optimal results.

#### (e) `Phase 5: Deployment`
Deploy the model for real-time predictions.
Monitor and update the model as needed.

#### (f) `Tools and Technologies:`

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow or PyTorch for modeling).

Jupyter Notebooks for code development and documentation.

Data visualization libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn).

#### (g) `Methodology`
To achieve the objectives, we will follow a structured approach:

Data Exploration: Thoroughly explore the provided datasets to understand the available features, their distributions, and relationships. This step will provide initial insights into the store sales data and help identify any data quality issues.

Data Preparation: Handle missing values, perform feature engineering, and encode categorical variables as necessary. This step may involve techniques like imputation, scaling, and one-hot encoding.

Time Series Analysis: Analyze the temporal aspects of the data, including trends, seasonality, and potential outliers. This analysis will provide a deeper understanding of the underlying patterns in store sales over time.

Model Selection and Training: Select appropriate time series forecasting models and train them using the prepared data. Consider incorporating external factors like promotions, holidays, and oil prices, if available, to enhance the forecasting accuracy.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained models using appropriate metrics, such as mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), or mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Assess the models' performance and identify the most accurate and reliable forecasting model.

Model Deployment and Forecasting: Deploy the chosen model to predict store sales for future time periods, leveraging the provided test dataset. Generate forecasts for the target period and assess the model's ability to capture the sales patterns accurately.

By following this methodology, we aim to provide valuable insights to the telecom company and develop a reliable predictive model for customer churn.

### 5. `Hypothesis formation`

`Null Hypothesis (H0):` Seasonal variations, including holiday events, promotions and oil prices have no significant impact on retail sales.

`Alternative Hypothesis (H1):` Seasonal variations, including holiday events, promotions and oil prices significantly influence retail sales.
